====
###### Stephanie Cleland, Nate Winters, Alex Goldschmidt, Amanda Savage, Steven Santos, Ian Fletcher

### Problem Statement
Patients only interact with their OTs for ~3 hours a day, but they live their limitations for all 24. Without their primary OTs present, caregivers might struggle not only to motivate the patient but also work towards improving their patient’s ADLs.
###### "The more that she (Alexa) can be happy and feel like she has increased independence, the more she will participate and work towards her therapy" -OT

### Customer Requirements
* Caregivers want to be able to personalize the patient’s care such that the patient is motivated to work towards improvement and increased independence in ADLs
* Caregivers want to be able to track the patient’s progress towards reaching set goals, through both detailed health data and understandable, generalized improvements
* Caregivers want to enable the patient to participate in activities they enjoyed prior to injury through improving motion necessary to complete those activities
* Caregivers want to be able to have set measurable, personalized goals, a “just right” challenge, for their patients to reach, starting at a measured baseline level
* Caregivers want the patient’s health data to be secure

### Major Functionality
* OT creates individualized activity based on a set of movements
* Physical device (Arduino with gyro / accelerometer) will be mounted on flexible band that can be worn on any place on any limb 
* Physical device and user input measure patient progress towards motions 
* Device is connected to app via wifi
* Daily activity progress is sent to the OT for future planning
* Activity data is displayed to caregiver by day / by activity
* Daily activity progress is communicated to caregiver 
* Goals can be set for each activity to motivate patient
